I forgot my keys again this morning, so I was late for work.
My cat just did the funniest thing, he was chasing his own tail.
I'm not really sure if I liked that movie, the ending was weird.
We’re planning to go hiking this weekend if the weather holds up.
I think I'm going to paint my room a light blue color.
My favorite food is pizza, especially with pineapple on it.
This new coffee shop down the street is actually pretty good.
I have to remember to buy milk on the way home.
Yesterday I ran into my old high school teacher at the store.
I'm so tired, I barely got any sleep last night.
My phone's battery dies way too fast these days.
I'm trying to learn guitar but it's harder than I thought.
We had a really nice dinner at that new Italian place.
I really need to do my laundry but I'm feeling lazy.
My brother just got a new job, so we're celebrating tonight.
I can't believe how much prices have gone up at the grocery store.
It's just one of those days, you know?
I'm trying to read more books this year.
I wonder if it's going to rain later today.
My laptop keeps crashing, I think I need a new one.
No one can have escaped that 2020 has been neither the easiest nor the most inspiring year to be a travel blogger.
 Even though I've traveled a lot in Sweden's long country and discovered sides of Sweden that I didn't think existed, 
 I've spent more time canceling trips than planning trips
 So, be sure to enter and follow and read all the winners' travel blogs, Instagram and YouTube.
There are so many incredibly talented Swedish travel bloggers out there to discover, hope you find some new favorites to follow!
One of Hollywood's most beloved actors,
Tom Hanks has an extraordinary talent that makes him relatable and versatile. 
Born in Concord, California, on July 9, 1956, he was raised with a passion for storytelling that led him to an acting career in the late 1970s.
 He rocketed to fame with the 1984 film Splash, and soon became a household name with the hits Big, Sleepless in Seattle, and A League of Their Own.
Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings.
In New York City, you’re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you’re not going to find a tea party. 
What you might find...? Well, that’s the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part series, The Underland Chronicles. 
Suzanne also has a rhyming picture book illustrated by Mike Lester entitled When Charlie McButton Lost Power.
She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. 
Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? 
If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test 
After college, Cassie lived in Los Angeles and New York where she worked at various entertainment magazines and
 even some rather suspect tabloids where she reported on Brad and Angelina’s world travels and Britney Spears’ wardrobe malfunctions.
  She started working on her YA novel, City of Bones, in 2004, inspired by the urban landscape of Manhattan, her favourite city. 
  The author's take on werewolves was original, and I gotta say they give the vampires a run for their money.
   I actually guessed most of the twists but that's some of the fun. 
   Finding the hints and feeling the satisfaction of saying YES! Score for me I got it right! Let's do a little victory dance.
   Alex Michaelides was born and raised in Cyprus. 
   He has an M.A. in English literature from Trinity College, Cambridge University, and an M.A. in screenwriting from the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.
The Silent Patient was his first novel and was the biggest-selling debut in the world in 2019.
It spent more than a year on the New York Times bestseller list and sold in a record-breaking forty-nine countries.
Alex lives in London.
